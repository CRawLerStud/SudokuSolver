# SudokuSolver
Just a sudoku solver that I made in a morning
You have to write the Sudoku table in "fisier.in" file for reading.
0 - means an empty space in table
any other number - means that the space is occupied.

If it is possible to solve, the message that will be displayed on the screen is "Rezolvat", else the message is "Imposibil".
Check the answer(final table) in "fisier.out".
